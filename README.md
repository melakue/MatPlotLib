# MatPlotLib


 MatPlotLib is used to analyze the ride sharing company data and offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.
 The data contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.
 
 The objective is to build a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:
 * Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition, you will be expected to produce the following three pie charts:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type
